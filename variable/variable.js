// Variables are Containers for Storing Data
// JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

// Automatically

// Using var

// Using let

// Using const


// Var Keyword:
// The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

// The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

// The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

var x = "Hello";
var y = "World";
console.log(x + y);


// Let Variable:
// Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared

// Variables defined with let must be Declared before use

// Variables defined with let have Block Scope



let z = "Hello World";
console.log(z);


// Const Variable:
// Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared

// Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned

// Variables defined with const have Block Scope


const second = "Hello World";
console.log(second);
